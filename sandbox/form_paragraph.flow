	textForParagraph = "The spectrum of treatment options for patients with a displaced fracture of the distal radius ranges from nonoperative (closed reduction and casting), to percutaneous pin fixation (with or without external-fixator placement), to open reduction and plate fixation (usually through a volar approach). Significant age-related and regional variations in treatment have been identified. Case-control studies have shown that patients who sustain these fractures more often have balance issues and abnormal trabecular-bone microstructure in the distal radius and tibia than their counterparts who donâ€™t have these fractures. In older patients with lower functional demand, radiographically determined residual fracture malalignment after nonoperative treatment is not directly correlated with worse patient-reported functional outcomes. While earlier research had indicated that treatment with high-dose vitamin C might improve functional outcomes, speed fracture healing, and limit the risk of complex regional pain syndrome, a recent randomized trial did not confirm those associations. A well-conducted controlled trial has shown that both plate fixation and percutaneous reduction/external fixation of intra-articular radial fractures provide optimum short-term clinical and functional outcomes during the first year after surgery, but functional results over a two-year period were better with the percutaneous approach, as long as the intra-articular step and gap deformity were minimized. When open reduction and plate fixation are selected through a shared decision making process, accelerated rehabilitation has been shown to be effective, as have surgeon-directed independent home exercise programs.";
